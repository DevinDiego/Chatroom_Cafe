# Chatroom_Cafe, A Social Network Clone.
This project was based off of a course I took on Udemy.
This is by far the most complex project I have accomplished.
I used this project for my Capstone Project at National University.
This social network clone is fully functional and our team had hosted
this on HostGator. 
There is too much cover in this read me file; however, you
could clone the code and run locally on a local server like XAMPP.
Although the website is fully functional it is not ready for actual
deployment to the public. There a number of security issues to be 
dealt with. 
Please keep in mind that I was in the early stages of learning
JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AJAX, and PHP.
